# üéØ Sentinel Integration: Business Philosophy & Methodology

**Understanding Sentinel's approach to application security and access control**

---

## üåü Executive Summary

Sentinel provides a **centralized, enterprise-grade RBAC platform** that your applications can leverage to achieve sophisticated access control without building permission systems from scratch. This document explains the business philosophy, methodology, and value proposition of integrating with Sentinel.

---

## üèóÔ∏è The Sentinel Philosophy

### **1. Centralized Authority, Distributed Applications**

**Philosophy**: One source of truth for all access control decisions across your application ecosystem.

**Business Value**:
- **Consistent Security**: All applications follow the same access control rules
- **Reduced Development Time**: No need to build permission systems per application  
- **Easier Compliance**: Centralized audit trails and access management
- **Lower Maintenance**: Security updates happen in one place

### **2. Zero-Trust Application Architecture**

**Philosophy**: Applications trust Sentinel completely, but Sentinel trusts no one without verification.

**Implementation**:
- Applications delegate ALL permission decisions to Sentinel
- Every user action requires Sentinel authorization
- Applications receive permission grants, not permission logic
- No hardcoded permissions or roles in application code

### **3. Business-First Access Model**

**Philosophy**: Permissions reflect real-world business relationships and organizational structures.

**Structure**:
```
Tenant (Company) 
  ‚Ü≥ Sub-Tenants (Departments)
    ‚Ü≥ Groups (Teams)
      ‚Ü≥ Users (People)
        ‚Ü≥ Roles (Job Functions)
          ‚Ü≥ Permissions (Specific Actions)
```

## üìä Business Model Integration

### **Tenant = Your Customer/Organization**

Each of your customers or organizational units gets their own **Tenant** in Sentinel:

| Your Business Model | Sentinel Tenant Model |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| **SaaS Customer** | Root Tenant (Acme Corp) |
| **Department** | Sub-Tenant (Acme-HR, Acme-Finance) |
| **Project/Division** | Sub-Tenant with isolated permissions |
| **Enterprise Client** | Root Tenant with complex sub-tenant hierarchy |

### **Application Resources = Business Objects**

Your application's features become **Resources** in Sentinel:

| Your Application | Sentinel Resources |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Customer Records** | `customer-data` resource |
| **Financial Reports** | `finance-reports` resource |
| **Admin Dashboard** | `admin-panel` resource |
| **User Profile Page** | `user-profile` resource |

### **Business Roles = Sentinel Roles**

Your organizational roles map directly to Sentinel:

| Business Role | Sentinel Role | Typical Permissions |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **CEO/Owner** | `super-admin` | Access to everything |
| **Department Head** | `department-admin` | Full access to department resources |
| **Manager** | `manager` | Read/write access to team resources |
| **Employee** | `employee` | Read access to relevant resources |
| **Intern** | `limited-user` | Restricted read access |

---

## üîÑ The Application-Sentinel Relationship

### **Phase 1: Setup (One-Time)**
1. **Super Admin** sets up your application as a new Tenant in Sentinel
2. **Tenant Admin** creates the access structure (roles, permissions, groups)
3. **Application** receives tenant configuration and API credentials

### **Phase 2: User Onboarding** 
1. **Tenant Admin** creates users in Sentinel (or via your app using Sentinel APIs)
2. Users are assigned to **Groups** (which have **Roles** with **Permissions**)
3. **Application** trusts that Sentinel has properly configured user access

### **Phase 3: Runtime Authorization**
1. User logs into **your application**
2. **Application** asks Sentinel: "What can this user do?"
3. **Sentinel** responds with permissions and personalized menus
4. **Application** shows/hides features based on Sentinel's response

## üíº Business Value Propositions

### **For Product Teams**

| Traditional Approach | Sentinel Integration |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Build permission system per app | Reuse enterprise-grade RBAC |
| 6-12 months development time | 2-4 weeks integration time |
| Custom security implementation | Battle-tested security platform |
| Limited audit capabilities | Complete compliance-ready audit trails |
| Hard to scale across apps | Seamless multi-application scaling |

### **For Engineering Teams**

| Without Sentinel | With Sentinel |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Complex permission logic in every app | Simple API calls to check permissions |
| Custom user management systems | Leverage Sentinel's user management |
| Manual role/permission administration | Dynamic, self-service permission management |
| Inconsistent security across apps | Standardized security model |

### **For Business Operations**

| Challenge | Sentinel Solution |
|-----------|------------------|
| **User Onboarding** | Single system manages all app access |
| **Role Changes** | Update once, affects all integrated apps |
| **Compliance Reporting** | Centralized audit trails across all apps |
| **Security Incidents** | Instant access revocation across all systems |

## üéØ Integration Methodologies

### **Method 1: Proxy Authorization Pattern** ‚≠ê **Recommended**

Your application acts as a "smart proxy" that consults Sentinel for every permission decision:

```
User Request ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Check with Sentinel ‚Üí Grant/Deny ‚Üí Response
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Maximum security (every action authorized)  
- ‚úÖ Real-time permission changes
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail
- ‚úÖ No stale permissions

### **Method 2: Token-Based Authorization**

Sentinel provides JWT tokens with embedded permissions:

```  
Login ‚Üí Sentinel Issues JWT ‚Üí Your App Validates Token ‚Üí Grant/Deny
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Reduced API calls (permissions in token)
- ‚úÖ Offline capability
- ‚ùå Less real-time (token refresh needed)
- ‚ùå Larger tokens with many permissions

### **Method 3: Cached Permission Pattern**

Your application caches user permissions from Sentinel:

```
Login ‚Üí Fetch Permissions from Sentinel ‚Üí Cache Locally ‚Üí Use Cache
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ High performance (local cache)
- ‚úÖ Reduced API calls
- ‚ùå Cache invalidation complexity
- ‚ùå Risk of stale permissions
